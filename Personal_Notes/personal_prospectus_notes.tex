		\textbf{\centering Things I want to talk about}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Why is the hyperbolic structure on $S_{0,3}$ unique?
			\item Make sure I understand hyperbolic structures
			\item Where to mention the map from the fundamental group to the group of reflections. \hl{We talked about moving the fundamental group stuff until later whenever we talk about geometric structures.}
			\item Break things up into propositions and lemmas.
			\item The $S_{0,3}$ is sphere minus three punctures. Call each puncture $p_{}$
			\item We can think of the boundary of the hyperbolic space as $\RP^1$. The space $\RP^1$ is the same as $\R \cup \infty$.
		\end{itemize}
